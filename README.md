# world_cup_database
A relational database made with PostgreSQL for freecodecamp relational databases certification.


I had to create a database, [worldcup](https://github.com/Kat-tat/world_cup_database/blob/main/worldcup.sql) corresponding to a provided csv file.


I then had to create a script [insert_data.sh](https://github.com/Kat-tat/world_cup_database/blob/main/insert_data%20(1).sh) to insert data into the database.


I then had to complete a script of queries provided, [queries.sh](https://github.com/Kat-tat/world_cup_database/blob/main/queries.sh), including joins, numeric functions and LIKE.
